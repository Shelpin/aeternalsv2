# ðŸš€ Aeternals: Autonomous Telegram Bot Network - Updated Implementation Plan (24-03-2024)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the current status, recent advancements, and next steps for the ElizaOS Multi-Agent Telegram System. The primary objective of this system is to create a network of AI agents that can engage in autonomous, natural conversations with each other and with human users in Telegram groups, creating the illusion of a living community with independent AI personalities.

The system solves a critical limitation in Telegram's platform: by default, bots cannot see messages from other bots in group chats. Our custom relay server architecture and direct Telegram API integration enable inter-bot message exchange, allowing our agents to respond to and interact with each other's messages.

Recent progress has been significant, particularly in addressing TypeScript build issues and proper SQLite integration. We've successfully:
1. Fixed ESM/CommonJS compatibility issues with the `better-sqlite3` package
2. Updated the build process to handle external dependencies correctly
3. Implemented proper TypeScript configuration
4. Added a default export to ensure compatibility with ElizaOS runtime
5. Improved direct SQLite integration without dynamic requires

This document serves as both an implementation guide and a knowledge repository for the project, ensuring that future work can be carried out with a clear understanding of the system's architecture and current state.

## 3. Recent Implementation Details

### 3.1 SQLite Adapter Improvements

We've significantly improved the SQLite adapter implementation by transitioning from dynamic requires to proper ES module imports:

```typescript
/**
 * This file serves as a proxy to the ElizaOS SQLite adapter.
 * It avoids direct imports of @elizaos/adapter-sqlite which might
 * not be available in all environments.
 */

// Import better-sqlite3 directly - we've ensured it's in our dependencies
import BetterSqlite3 from 'better-sqlite3';

// Define basic types for compatibility
export interface Database {
  exec: (sql: string) => void;
  prepare: (sql: string) => {
    run: (...params: any[]) => any;
    get: (...params: any[]) => any;
    all: (...params: any[]) => any[];
  };
  close: () => void;
}

// Define a minimal compatible adapter
export class SqliteDatabaseAdapter {
  public db: Database;
  private dbPath: string;

  constructor(dbPath: string) {
    this.dbPath = dbPath;
    console.log(`[SQLITE] Initializing database at path: ${dbPath}`);
    
    try {
      // Create a new database instance
      this.db = new BetterSqlite3(dbPath);
      console.log('[SQLITE] Successfully created SQLite database');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('[SQLITE] Failed to create SQLite database:', error);
      throw new Error(`Failed to create SQLite database: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)}`);
    }
  }
  
  async init() {
    // This would normally initialize tables, but we'll let the coordination adapter handle it
    console.log('[SQLITE] Adapter initialized');
  }

  async close() {
    if (this.db) {
      try {
        this.db.close();
        console.log('[SQLITE] Database closed successfully');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('[SQLITE] Error closing SQLite database:', error);
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Helper methods for working with the database
  
  async createTable(tableName: string, schema: string) {
    try {
      this.db.exec(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ${tableName} (${schema})`);
      console.log(`[SQLITE] Created table: ${tableName}`);
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`[SQLITE] Error creating table ${tableName}:`, error);
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  prepare(sql: string) {
    return this.db.prepare(sql);
  }
  
  exec(sql: string) {
    return this.db.exec(sql);
  }
}
```

### 3.2 ES Module Integration

We've properly configured the module to use ES modules with direct imports:

```typescript
import { Plugin } from './types';
import { TelegramMultiAgentPlugin } from './TelegramMultiAgentPlugin';
// Import better-sqlite3 directly at the module level
import BetterSqlite3 from 'better-sqlite3';

// Debug log to understand module loading
console.log('[DEBUG] telegram-multiagent index.ts is being evaluated');

// Make better-sqlite3 available globally if needed
globalThis.betterSqlite3 = BetterSqlite3;
console.log('[DEBUG] BetterSqlite3 imported and made globally available');

// ... [rest of the code]

// Create a formal plugin object
export const telegramMultiAgentPlugin = {
  name: "@elizaos/telegram-multiagent",
  description: "Enables multi-agent coordination in Telegram groups",
  npmName: "@elizaos/telegram-multiagent",

  initialize: async function() {
    console.log('[PLUGIN_OBJECT] telegramMultiAgentPlugin.initialize called');
    return pluginInstance.initialize();
  },

  shutdown: async function() {
    console.log('[PLUGIN_OBJECT] telegramMultiAgentPlugin.shutdown called');
    return pluginInstance.shutdown();
  }
} as Plugin;

// Add default export for compatibility with ElizaOS plugin system
export default telegramMultiAgentPlugin;

// Final debug log
console.log('[DEBUG] telegram-multiagent index.ts evaluation complete');
```

### 3.3 Package.json Configuration

We've updated the package.json to properly declare dependencies and build settings:

```json
{
  "name": "@elizaos/telegram-multiagent",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Multi-agent coordination for Telegram bots in ElizaOS",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm run clean && npm run build:esm && npm run build:types",
    "build:esm": "esbuild src/index.ts --bundle --platform=node --target=node16 --format=esm --outfile=dist/index.js --external:@elizaos/core --external:better-sqlite3 --external:sqlite --external:sqlite3 --external:uuid",
    "build:types": "tsc --emitDeclarationOnly",
    "yolo-build": "node build-yolo.js",
    "clean": "rimraf dist",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext .ts",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@elizaos/core": "^0.25.9",
    "axios": "^1.6.2",
    "better-sqlite3": "^11.9.1",
    "sqlite": "^5.0.1",
    "sqlite3": "^5.1.6",
    "uuid": "^9.0.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/better-sqlite3": "^7.6.9",
    "@types/jest": "^29.5.10",
    "@types/node": "^20.10.0",
    "@types/uuid": "^9.0.7",
    "esbuild": "^0.20.0",
    "eslint": "^8.54.0",
    "jest": "^29.7.0",
    "rimraf": "^5.0.5",
    "ts-jest": "^29.1.1",
    "typescript": "^5.3.2"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@elizaos/core": "^0.25.9"
  }
}
```

### 3.4 TypeScript Configuration

We've optimized the TypeScript configuration for ES modules:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["ESNext", "dom"],
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": false,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": false,
    "declaration": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "allowJs": true,
    "noEmitOnError": false
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "**/*.test.ts", "**/*.spec.ts"]
}
```

### 3.5 Improved Runtime Registration (New)

We've significantly enhanced the runtime registration process to ensure reliable operation without depending on the FORCE_RUNTIME_AVAILABLE flag:

```typescript
// In index.ts
// Global runtime reference
let sharedRuntime = null;

/**
 * Pre-register the runtime with the plugin
 * This should be called by ElizaOS core during plugin loading
 */
export function preRegisterRuntime(runtime) {
  if (!runtime) {
    console.warn('[PLUGIN] telegram-multiagent: Attempted to register null runtime');
    return;
  }
  
  console.log('[PLUGIN] telegram-multiagent: Pre-registering runtime');
  
  // Store runtime in module-level variable
  sharedRuntime = runtime;
  
  // Also make available globally for legacy code
  try {
    globalThis.__elizaRuntime = runtime;
    globalThis.__telegramMultiAgentRuntime = runtime;
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('[PLUGIN] telegram-multiagent: Failed to store runtime globally', error);
  }
}

/**
 * Get the shared runtime instance
 */
export function getSharedRuntime() {
  return sharedRuntime;
}
```

### 3.6 Enhanced Runtime Detection (New)

We've improved how the plugin detects and accesses the runtime across different modules:

```typescript
// In TelegramMultiAgentPlugin.ts
/**
 * Check if runtime is available and ready
 */
private isRuntimeAvailable(): boolean {
  try {
    // First check runtime initialization flag
    if (this.runtimeInitialized && this.runtime) {
      return true;
    }
    
    // Check for plugin forced availability
    if (process.env.FORCE_RUNTIME_AVAILABLE === 'true') {
      this.logger.warn('Forcing runtime availability due to environment flag');
      this.runtimeInitialized = true;
      return true;
    }
    
    // Try global references
    try {
      if ((globalThis as any).__telegramMultiAgentRuntime) {
        this.logger.info('Found runtime in global telegramMultiAgentRuntime variable');
        this.runtime = (globalThis as any).__telegramMultiAgentRuntime;
        this.runtimeInitialized = true;
        return true;
      }
      
      if ((globalThis as any).__elizaRuntime) {
        this.logger.info('Found runtime in global elizaRuntime variable');
        this.runtime = (globalThis as any).__elizaRuntime;
        this.runtimeInitialized = true;
        return true;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      this.logger.debug('Error accessing global runtime:', error);
    }
    
    this.logger.debug('Runtime not available after all checks');
    return false;
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error('Error checking runtime availability:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

## 4. Current Build Process

The current build process has been refined to properly handle ES modules and TypeScript:

1. **Plugin Build Process**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the plugin directory
   cd /root/eliza/packages/telegram-multiagent
   
   # Run the build script
   pnpm build
   
   # This executes:
   # 1. npm run clean - Cleans the dist directory
   # 2. npm run build:esm - Bundles using esbuild with external dependencies
   # 3. npm run build:types - Generates TypeScript declarations
   ```

2. **Project-wide Build Process**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the ElizaOS root directory
   cd /root/eliza
   
   # Build all packages, filtering for telegram-multiagent
   pnpm build -- --filter=@elizaos/telegram-multiagent
   ```

3. **Agent Restart Process**:
   ```bash
   # Stop all agents
   ./stop_agents.sh
   
   # Start a specific agent
   ./start_agents.sh linda_evangelista_88
   ```

## 6. Technical Debt

### 6.1 Current Technical Debt

1. **ES Module / CommonJS Compatibility**:
   - Although we've made significant progress with ES modules, some edge cases may still exist
   - Dynamic imports and requires may still cause issues in certain scenarios
   - Better testing across different Node.js environments is needed

2. **TypeScript Project Structure**:
   - The project would benefit from a more structured TypeScript project reference system
   - Currently using a simplified build approach that could be optimized
   - Lacks consistent tsconfig inheritance across packages

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Configuration is spread across multiple sources (environment variables, JSON files, code defaults)
   - Changes to the configuration file (agent/config/plugins/telegram-multiagent.json) are not consistently being picked up by the plugin during runtime
   - Some settings require direct code changes rather than configuration updates

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The error handling in various parts of the codebase is inconsistent
   - Some errors are logged but not properly addressed
   - Recovery mechanisms for failed operations are limited

5. **Hard-coded Values**:
   - Several hard-coded values exist in the codebase, such as fallback group IDs and agent-specific token lookups
   - Direct IP addresses (207.180.245.243) are used in multiple places instead of configuration variables

6. **Test Coverage**:
   - Unit test coverage is limited
   - Integration tests for the full system are manual
   - Test automation is minimal

### 6.2 Debt Reduction Plan

1. **Short-Term (1-2 weeks)**:
   - Standardize ES module imports throughout the codebase
   - Improve TypeScript configuration for better build reliability
   - Create a shared tsconfig.base.json for consistent settings
   - Add better-sqlite3 as a proper dependency in package.json (completed)
   - Replace hardcoded IPs with configuration variables

2. **Medium-Term (2-4 weeks)**:
   - Refactor configuration management
   - Implement comprehensive logging strategy
   - Create automated test suite for core functionality
   - Fix TypeScript warnings and improve type safety
   - Improve dynamic configuration loading

3. **Long-Term (1-2 months)**:
   - Complete code documentation
   - Refactor architecture for better separation of concerns
   - Implement continuous integration for testing
   - Create robust error recovery mechanisms
   - Build a configuration management system that doesn't require rebuilds

## 7. Build and Deployment Guide

### 7.1 Plugin-Only Build

```bash
# Navigate to the plugin directory
cd /root/eliza/packages/telegram-multiagent

# Build the plugin
pnpm build

# Alternatively, for backwards compatibility:
node build-yolo.js
```

### 7.2 Full Project Build

```bash
# Navigate to the ElizaOS root directory
cd /root/eliza

# Build the entire project
pnpm build

# Or build just the telegram-multiagent plugin
pnpm build -- --filter=@elizaos/telegram-multiagent
```

### 7.3 Agent Management

```bash
# Stop all agents
cd /root/eliza
./stop_agents.sh

# Start all agents
./start_agents.sh

# Start a specific agent
./start_agents.sh linda_evangelista_88
```

### 7.4 Log Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor all agent logs
cd /root/eliza
tail -f logs/*.log | grep "TelegramMultiAgentPlugin"

# Monitor a specific agent's logs
tail -f logs/linda_evangelista_88.log
```

## 8. Conclusion

We've made significant progress in improving the ElizaOS Multi-Agent Telegram System, particularly in addressing TypeScript and ES module compatibility issues. The system now properly integrates better-sqlite3 using ES module imports, has a streamlined build process, and includes a default export for ElizaOS runtime compatibility.

Our recent work focused on transitioning from dynamic requires to proper ES module imports, ensuring that the plugin works correctly in an ES module context while maintaining proper TypeScript type definitions. We've also fixed the build process to handle external dependencies correctly and updated the package.json configuration.

While we've addressed many technical debt items, there remain opportunities for further improvements, particularly in the TypeScript project structure, configuration management, and runtime initialization process. Our next steps focus on enhancing these areas while continuing to improve the core functionality of the system.

With the foundation now properly established, we can focus on enhancing the conversation quality and expanding the system's capabilities for more diverse interaction patterns. The ElizaOS Multi-Agent Telegram System is well-positioned to continue evolving into a robust platform for autonomous agent interactions in Telegram.
