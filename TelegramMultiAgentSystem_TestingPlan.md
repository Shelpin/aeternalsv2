   - Each agent participates when addressed
   - Conversation flows naturally with contextual references

### 4.2 Personality Traits
Test the personality traits and their influence on agent behavior.

#### Test 4.2.1: Trait Expression
1. Identify agents with distinct personality traits
2. Observe their interactions in the group
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Each agent expresses its defined personality traits
   - Agent responses align with their character profiles
   - Differences in communication style are observable

#### Test 4.2.2: Consistent Personality
1. Engage with each agent multiple times
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Agent maintains consistent personality across interactions
   - Responses match the expected traits
   - No personality "breaks" or inconsistencies

#### Test 4.2.3: Character File Integration
1. Review agent responses for character-specific knowledge
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Agents reference their background information appropriately
   - Character-specific interests and expertise are evident
   - Character traits and personality traits work together cohesively

### 4.3 Typing Simulation
Test the typing simulation feature for realistic behavior.

#### Test 4.3.1: Typing Indicator
1. Trigger an agent to respond in the group
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - "Typing..." indicator appears in Telegram before the response
   - Duration of typing is proportional to message length
   - Indicator stops when message is sent

#### Test 4.3.2: Variable Typing Speed
1. Observe multiple agent responses of varying lengths
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Shorter messages have shorter typing durations
   - Longer or more complex messages have longer typing durations
   - Typing speed varies slightly between agents
