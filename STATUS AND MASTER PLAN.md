# Aeternals: Autonomous Telegram Bot Network - Status & Master Plan

## 1. Current Status Analysis

### 1.1 Project Overview

The ElizaOS Multi-Agent Telegram System (Aeternals) aims to create a network of AI agents that can engage in autonomous, natural conversations with each other and with human users in Telegram groups. The primary technical challenge being solved is overcoming Telegram's platform limitation where bots cannot see messages from other bots in group chats.

| **Relay Server** | ✅ Operational | Successfully enables bot-to-bot message visibility |
| **Agent Management** | ✅ Operational | Process management with port/PID handling for 6 agents |
| **SQLite Integration** | ✅ Operational | Proper imports with better-sqlite3 (ESM compatible) |
| **Telegram Integration** | ✅ Operational | Direct API for responses works correctly |
| **Message Processing** | ✅ Operational | Agents can see and process each other's messages |
| **Build System** | ✅ Operational | TypeScript/ESM configuration properly set up |
| **Runtime Registration** | ✅ Operational | Reliable global runtime reference system |

## 7. Conclusion

This master plan outlines a systematic approach to transform the current Aeternals system into a fully functional, human-like conversation platform for Telegram using ElizaOS. By focusing on strong foundations, enhancing conversation capabilities, and properly integrating with ElizaOS best practices, we can achieve the final objective while making a valuable contribution to the ElizaOS ecosystem.

The implementation will proceed in phases, addressing technical debt, enhancing core functionality, and adding advanced features in a systematic manner. Throughout this process, we'll maintain a commitment to following best practices, avoiding workarounds, and ensuring that our contribution is valuable to the broader ElizaOS community.

## Current System Analysis Update (After Testing)

After extensive analysis of the system, including log review and live testing, I've identified several critical issues preventing the multi-agent conversation system from working properly:

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Interval Registration Bug**: 
   - The conversation check interval that should trigger kickstarters is never properly registered.
   - In the current `TelegramMultiAgentPlugin.ts`, the `checkIntervalId` is declared but never initialized with `setInterval()`
   - Only in the backup version (`TelegramMultiAgentPlugin.old.backup`) was this properly implemented: `this.checkIntervalId = setInterval(() => {`
   - This means conversations are never automatically kickstarted

2. **Relay Server Message Routing Issues**:
   - Test messages sent to the relay server fail with: `❌ SendMessage failed: Missing required parameters` or `❌ SendMessage failed: Invalid agent_id or token`
   - The relay server rejects messages from unregistered agents (like our test script)
   - Agent registration appears to work (heartbeats are successful), but message routing is problematic

3. **Runtime Integration Issues**:
   - The current implementation uses non-standard global runtime access:
   ```typescript
   (globalThis as any).__telegramMultiAgentRuntime = runtime;
   (globalThis as any).__elizaRuntime = runtime;
   ```
   - This approach is fragile and doesn't follow ElizaOS plugin patterns

4. **Conversation State Management**:
   - The system doesn't properly utilize ElizaOS memory manager for conversation state
   - Each agent has a separate conversation state with no shared context
   - There's no proper turn-taking mechanism to ensure coherent conversations

### Action Plan Priority Updates

Based on these findings, I recommend updating our action plan priorities:

1. **Fix Conversation Kickstarter (HIGHEST)**:
   - Implement proper interval registration for conversation checks
   - Restore the missing setInterval call:
   ```typescript
   this.checkIntervalId = setInterval(() => {
     this.checkConversations().catch(error => {
       this.logger.error(`Error in conversation check: ${error}`);
     });
   }, this.config.conversationCheckIntervalMs || 60000);
   ```

2. **Improve Relay Server Message Handling (HIGH)**:
   - Add better error reporting and logging in relay server
   - Implement more robust message validation and routing
   - Add detailed debug logs for message flow

3. **Fix Runtime Integration (HIGH)**:
   - Replace global runtime references with proper ElizaOS plugin patterns
   - Implement standard register() lifecycle method
   - Create a module-level shared runtime system without globalThis

4. **Enhance Conversation State (MEDIUM)**:
   - Utilize ElizaOS memory manager for conversation state
   - Implement proper turn-taking mechanisms
   - Use runtime.composeState() for context management

These changes will address the most critical issues preventing proper multi-agent conversations.
