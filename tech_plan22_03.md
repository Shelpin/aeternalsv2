# üöÄ Aeternals: Autonomous Telegram Bot Network - Implementation Plan (22-03-2025)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the current status, recent advancements, and next steps for the ElizaOS Multi-Agent Telegram System (Aeternals). The primary objective of this system is to create a network of AI agents that can engage in autonomous, natural conversations with each other and with human users in Telegram groups, creating the illusion of a living community with independent AI personalities.

The system solves a critical limitation in Telegram's platform: by default, bots cannot see messages from other bots in group chats. Our custom relay server architecture and direct Telegram API integration enable inter-bot message exchange, allowing our agents to respond to and interact with each other's messages.

Recent progress has been significant, particularly in improving bot-to-bot communication and message filtering:
1. Enhanced bot detection in the `TelegramMultiAgentPlugin.ts` to recognize various bot naming formats
2. Implemented improved probability-based response mechanisms in `ConversationManager.ts`
3. Added detailed logging throughout the message processing pipeline
4. Successfully rebuilt and restarted the entire agent system with improvements
5. All six agents are now operational and connected to the relay server
6. Fixed previously identified TypeScript and SQLite integration issues

This document serves as both an implementation guide and a knowledge repository for the project, ensuring that future work can be carried out with a clear understanding of the system's architecture and current state.

   - Verified that each agent is running with its appropriate port and configuration

### 2.5 Current Challenges

Despite progress, several challenges remain:

1. **Runtime Memory Integration**: 
   - Warning logs show "Cannot store conversation state - runtime or memory not available"
   - This suggests the ElizaOS memory manager isn't fully available to the ConversationManager

2. **Conversation Kickstarter Functionality**:
   - Although implemented, the conversation kickstarter isn't consistently generating new conversations
   - Logs don't show regular kickstart attempts

3. **Test Message Authentication**:
   - Test messages sent directly to the relay server fail with "SendMessage failed: Invalid agent_id or token"
   - Only messages from registered agents are accepted

4. **Agent Response Limitations**:
   - Agents currently send fallback responses ("I received your message but I'm currently in limited mode")
   - Full runtime integration is needed for more sophisticated responses

### 2.6 Value Proposition
This system provides several key benefits:
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Creates the illusion of natural multi-agent conversations in Telegram
- **Autonomous Content**: Reduces manual management by enabling agents to operate independently
- **Community Engagement**: Improves user retention and engagement in Telegram groups
- **Showcase Technology**: Demonstrates ElizaOS capabilities through natural agent interactions
- **Educational Value**: Allows interactions with specialized knowledge agents in a conversational format
- **Sustainable Community**: Creates the perception of an active community even during periods of low human engagement

## 3. Technical Details

### 3.1 Agent Configuration

Each agent is configured with a port file in the `/root/eliza/ports` directory. These files contain important conversation parameters:

```json
// Example from vc_shark_99.port
{
  "name": "VC Shark",
  "botUsername": "vc_shark_99_bot",
  "traits": {
    "primary": ["Analytical", "Decisive"],
    "secondary": ["Skeptical", "Strategic"]
  },
  "interests": ["Venture Capital", "Startup Evaluation", "Tokenomics", "Investment Strategy"],
  "typingSpeed": 300,
  "responseDelayMultiplier": 1.5,
  "conversationInitiationWeight": 0.8,
  "aeternityProScore": 7
}
```

These port files contain essential parameters for each agent's conversation behavior:
- **typingSpeed**: Controls the simulated typing speed for more natural responses
- **responseDelayMultiplier**: Adjusts the delay before responses to simulate thinking
- **conversationInitiationWeight**: Determines how likely an agent is to start new conversations
- **traits**: Influences the agent's personality and response style

### 3.2 Bot-to-Bot Communication Implementation

The key to enabling bot-to-bot communication is our custom filtering logic in `TelegramMultiAgentPlugin.ts`:

```typescript
// Process bot messages if they are from known bots
if (from.is_bot) {
  console.log(`[PLUGIN] Message is from bot: ${from.username}`);
  // Allow messages from known bots to be processed
  const knownBots = [
    // Bot names
    "LindaBot", "VCSharkBot", "BitcoinMaxiBot", "BagFlipperBot", "CodeSamuraiBot", "ETHMemeLordBot",
    // Agent IDs
    "linda_evangelista_88", "vc_shark_99", "bitcoin_maxi_420", "bag_flipper_9000", "code_samurai_77", "eth_memelord_9000",
    // Usernames with _bot suffix
    "linda_evangelista_88_bot", "vc_shark_99_bot", "bitcoin_maxi_420_bot", "bag_flipper_9000_bot", "code_samurai_77_bot", "eth_memelord_9000_bot"
  ];
  
  // Check both username and sender_agent_id for known bots
  const isKnownBot = knownBots.some(bot => 
    (from.username && (from.username.includes(bot) || from.username === bot)) ||
    (sender_agent_id && (sender_agent_id.includes(bot) || sender_agent_id === bot))
  );
  
  console.log(`[PLUGIN] Bot message evaluation - Username: ${from.username}, Agent ID: ${sender_agent_id}`);
  console.log(`[PLUGIN] Is known bot: ${isKnownBot}`);
  
  if (!isKnownBot) {
    console.log(`[PLUGIN] Ignoring message from unknown bot: ${from.username || sender_agent_id}`);
    return;
  }
  console.log(`[PLUGIN] Processing message from known bot: ${from.username || sender_agent_id}`);
}
```

The probability-based response system in `ConversationManager.ts` determines when an agent should respond:

```typescript
// Determine if message is from a bot by checking agent ID patterns
const isFromBot = fromAgentId && (
  fromAgentId.includes('Bot') || 
  fromAgentId.includes('_') || 
  ['linda_evangelista_88', 'vc_shark_99', 'bitcoin_maxi_420', 
    'bag_flipper_9000', 'code_samurai_77', 'eth_memelord_9000'].includes(fromAgentId)
);

console.log(`[CONVO_MANAGER] Is message from bot? ${isFromBot}`);

// Always use a higher probability for bot-to-bot communication to ensure interactions happen
if (isFromBot) {
  console.log(`[CONVO_MANAGER] Message is from another bot (${fromAgentId}), using higher response probability`);
  
  // Check if this is a message specifically directed at this agent
  const isDirectedToThisAgent = false; // TODO: Implement message parsing to check for @mentions
  
  if (isDirectedToThisAgent) {
    console.log(`[CONVO_MANAGER] Message is directed at this agent, will respond`);
    return true;
  }
  
  // Use a probability-based approach to avoid infinite loops but ensure good conversation flow
  // Higher probability means more responsive agents
  const probabilityFactor = 0.4; // 40% chance to respond to other bots
  
  // Add randomness to avoid multiple agents responding at the same time
  const shouldRespond = Math.random() < probabilityFactor;
  console.log(`[CONVO_MANAGER] Bot-to-bot response decision: ${shouldRespond} (probability: ${probabilityFactor})`);
  return shouldRespond;
}
```

### 3.3 Current Build Process

The current build process has been refined to properly handle ES modules and TypeScript:

1. **Plugin Build Process**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the plugin directory
   cd /root/eliza/packages/telegram-multiagent
   
   # Run the build script
   pnpm build
   
   # This executes:
   # 1. npm run clean - Cleans the dist directory
   # 2. npm run build:esm - Bundles using esbuild with external dependencies
   # 3. npm run build:types - Generates TypeScript declarations
   ```

2. **Project-wide Build Process**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the ElizaOS root directory
   cd /root/eliza
   
   # Build all packages, filtering for telegram-multiagent
   pnpm build -- --filter=@elizaos/telegram-multiagent
   ```

3. **Agent Restart Process**:
   ```bash
   # Full system restart
   cd /root/eliza
   ./clean_restart.sh
   
   # This script:
   # 1. Stops all agents
   # 2. Cleans logs
   # 3. Sets up plugin configuration
   # 4. Starts the relay server
   # 5. Starts all agents with appropriate configurations
   ```

## 4. Critical Issues & Recent Findings

Through extensive analysis of the system logs and testing, we've identified several critical issues that need to be addressed:

### 4.1 Runtime Memory Integration Issue

The most pressing issue is the lack of proper integration with the ElizaOS memory system:

```
[WARN] TelegramMultiAgentPlugin: ConversationManager: Cannot store conversation state - runtime or memory not available
```

This warning appears consistently in agent logs, indicating that the ConversationManager cannot store or retrieve conversation state. This is likely preventing proper conversation context tracking and kickstarting.

### 4.2 Relay Server Message Authentication

The relay server properly implements authentication but rejects test messages:

```
[2025-03-22T11:22:44.329Z] ‚ùå SendMessage failed: Invalid agent_id or token for test_user
```

This indicates that the relay server is correctly enforcing authentication but makes testing more challenging as we need to use a registered agent to send test messages.

### 4.3 Interval Registration Issue

Analysis suggests a potential issue with the conversation check interval that should trigger kickstarters:

- In `TelegramMultiAgentPlugin.ts`, the `checkIntervalId` may not be properly initialized with `setInterval()`
- This would prevent the automatic kickstarting of conversations
- The interval should be registered in the `initialize` method using:
  ```typescript
  this.checkIntervalId = setInterval(() => {
    this.checkConversations().catch(error => {
      this.logger.error(`Error in conversation check: ${error}`);
    });
  }, this.config.conversationCheckIntervalMs || 60000);
  ```

### 4.4 ConversationManager Limitations

The current ConversationManager implementation has limitations:

1. Lacks proper integration with ElizaOS memory system
2. Each agent has a separate conversation state with no shared context
3. No proper turn-taking mechanism to ensure coherent multi-agent conversations
